# Boundary Definer 

Boundary Definer is a product made for the IMT&S - a fourth-year project at the CMGT course at Saxion University of Applied Sciences.

During this project I was the main engineer, that's why most of the code was written by me. The only parts I did not code are the ones connected to the Networking part of the product.
