# Boundary Definer 

Boundary Definer is a product developed for the IMT&S project as part of the fourth-year course - Creative Media and Game Technologies - at Saxion University of Applied Sciences.

As the main engineer for this project, I was responsible for writing most of the code. The only parts I did not contribute to were related to the networking functionality.

Beyond programming, I also took on the role of a technical designer with a specific focus: creating tools to streamline the work of our artists and designers throughout the project.

My primary focus was developing a tool for creating and customizing graphs, which serve as a central component of our app. I aimed to make the tool intuitive and highly adjustable, allowing designers to create and modify graphs without needing to edit the code. This approach ensured that team members could independently adjust the graph as needed, enabling smoother collaboration and reducing reliance on my availability for technical guidance.
